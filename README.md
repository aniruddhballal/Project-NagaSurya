# This branch contains conclusive codes and plots that are in the tail end of development.

**13th July** consists of codes and plots that represent the final version of the code I had been trying to develop since the beginning. It plots the 4-in-1 plot with visual representations of the two of the highest magnitude ALM's YLM functions.

**16th July** consists of the final codes relating to the Centre of Mass (COM) concept introduced towards the later stages of the development of the above code. No conclusive findings that are of any surprise. It just seems to correspond to the other ways of representing the solar magnetic flux data. Could look more into it, further down the lane.

**18th July** is simply an animated compilation of all the plots I had accumulated so far with all the versions of codes and their respective yet random side quests.
